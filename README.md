Interactive tutorial to kill the boss TzTok-Jad in the Fight Caves on Oldschool Runescape

This is a video of the boss here: https://youtu.be/O0oCxeeF2ss?t=25m18s

The idea I got this off of was to improve the already existing one here: http://runeapps.org/jadsim_app and create it for the old-school version of Runescape.

It's a simple java based game and the graphics are a low resolution but I would like to make a tutorial to teach players how to prayer switch.

Hiring pixel artists for the sprites shown here.
